# Setting up this website.  

## Choosing a Static Site Generator.  

- jekyll  
    - Appears to be phasing out in popularity for better, lighterweight options.
- hugo  
    - Hearing great things about it, but the documentation is rough to follow. 
    - I have had better luck following documenation for themes when getting started (see next header)
- mkdocs  
    - Lightweight and simple. Really would perfer something like this. 
- MyST
    - Jupyter support. Use it for work documentation. My switch to this at somepoint. But themes were limited. 

Ultimately I landed on Hugo due to a want to learn it and also the theme options are great. 

## Hugo Hextra Theme

[https://imfing.github.io/hextra/](https://imfing.github.io/hextra/)

The hextra theme seemed like a decent decision. It has:

- A clean look
- Good documentation.
- Easy bloggin ability
- Search
- Expandability
- Full markdown support

### Blog setup

Getting started on the blog was as simple as writing this markdown file and pushing the changes to github.
